# OutputHooker
![OutputHooker](OutputHooker.png)

A modern reimagining of MAMEHooker, built for the latest Windows environments.  
This tool acts as the essential bridge between emulators and your arcade hardware (Lightguns, LEDs, ...).

***
## Features
### Windows Support
*   **OutputHooker** is fully optimized for Windows 10 and 11

### Output Support
*   Network - Receive output data over network connections for modern setups
*   Windows Messages - Full backward compatibility with the "old" Windows messaging system
*   This means that any emulator, launcher, or tool works with **OutputHooker**!

### Hardware Support
*   Lightguns with COM Port support (GUN4IR, Blamcon, RS3 Reaper, OpenFIRE, X-Gunner, ...)
*   LEDWiz boards (Original, Clone, Pinscape)
*   Ultimarc LED boards

### INI Support
* MAMEHooker INI files and KeyStates are supported
*   **OutputHooker** features a built-in editor inspired by the original MAMEHooker workflow,  
     allowing you to configure hardware triggers without leaving the app

## Getting Started
1. Download the latest build from the [Releases](https://github.com/PolybiusExtreme/OutputHooker/releases) page

2. Configure your emulator (e.g., MAME) to broadcast outputs via TCP or Windows Messages

3. Launch the application, start a game and use the INI Editor to define your hardware mappings

4. **Watch your cabinet come to life!**

## Support
See the [Wiki](https://github.com/PolybiusExtreme/OutputHooker/wiki) for detailed instructions.  
Due to time constraints, I cannot offer any support.  
I am just one man that wanted to build a modern MAMEHooker alternative for my selfmade Arcade machine.

## Contributing
If you have suggestions, bug reports, or want to contribute to the code,  
feel free to open an [issue](https://github.com/PolybiusExtreme/OutputHooker/issues) or submit a [pull request](https://github.com/PolybiusExtreme/OutputHooker/pulls).

## Build
Most of the application is Qt-based,  
so you'll need the Qt environment along with the MSVC 2022 toolchain.  
For the hardware side, I’ve integrated the improved LEDWiz SDK  
and the Ultimarc PacDrive SDK for the LED boards.
- Qt 6.10.2 with a CMake file with MSVC 2022
- CMake Version: 3.30.5
- LEDWiz SDK - [https://github.com/mjrgh/lwcloneu2](https://github.com/mjrgh/lwcloneu2)
- Ultimarc PacDrive SDK - [https://www.ultimarc.com/PacDriveSDK.zip](https://www.ultimarc.com/PacDriveSDK.zip)
